### What is SimpleNews?

SimpleNews is a great application that puts weather and news at your fingertips. The card based display allows you to quickly move between the latest weather and news headline while deeper integration allows you to find out more about the weekly forecast or check out news from various categories.
The news is based off of pre-selected RSS feeds from some of the most reliable news sources such as the New York Times, Reuters, ESPN, US News, Tech Crunch, and more! If our selection is not good enough, dive into the settings and customize until your feed is perfect! With pocket integration you can easily save an article you like for later or read it now in a custom, lightweight web view.

Don’t overcomplicate weather with fancy charts that don’t mean much, we deliver the most important weather information at a glance for the week ahead. Weather information is provided by openweathermap.org so you know it is reliable.

SimpleNews is just that, simple. It’s a one stop shop for everything you need to keep up with the world.
